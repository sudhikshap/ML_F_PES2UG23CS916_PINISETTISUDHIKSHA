Comparative Analysis Report
1. Algorithm Performance
The mushroom dataset achieved the highest accuracy. This is because its features/attributes are very distinct, making edible vs poisonous separation easy. Dataset size also matters as mushroom had a large, clean dataset. 
2. Data Characteristics Impact
Class imbalance affected performance the most in tictactoe as draws and losses overlap a lot. Binary attributes like in tictactoe are simpler but sometimes limited, while multi-valued features in mushroom and nursery gave better splits.
3. Practical Applications
Mushroom data is useful in food safety and biology, where clear decision paths are important for safety-critical predictions. Tictactoe is more of a game AI example, showing how decision trees work with small state spaces. Nursery dataset is closer to real-world decision support, like school admissions, where multiple social and family factors matter. Decision trees work best here because the rules are clear and simple.
4. Improvements
For mushroom, the tree is already very strong, but pruning could reduce complexity. For tictactoe, handling class imbalance would help. For nursery, feature selection or reducing noise would improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.
